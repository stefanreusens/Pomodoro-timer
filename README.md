# Pomodoro-timer

## About this project

We received the assignment making a Pomodoro-timer.
You can set the time for a work-session and a break-session.

As soon as the work-session is finished, an alarm goes off. The break-session starts automaticly.
After the break-session the work-session starts again. 

## Install

Your webbrowser should open http://localhost:3000/ automaticly. If not, click [here](http://localhost:3000/). You can now play the game. Enjoy!
